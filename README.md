# AutoGen Sakila Chat — AI-to-Database Query Tool

This project demonstrates how to use **[Microsoft AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html)** to build a simple **AI chat interface** that can answer natural-language questions using real data from the **Sakila database**.

It is designed as a technical prototype for demonstrating **AI + SQL + multi-agent system** interaction — where a Large Language Model (LLM) can translate prompts into safe SQL queries, execute them against a given database, and return summarized results in natural language.
